# Anglish Writer-Righter (*"Spellcheck"*)

Anglish is a reworking of English, as if the French had never overrun the British island in 1066, leaving the tongue less touched by far-away infloodings (French and also Latin and Greekish).

Anglish often feels more earthy, more grounded in the guts than English. For more on Anglish, see [the Anglish moot](https://anglish.fandom.com/wiki/What_is_Anglish%3F) (which is where our word list came from).

Heed that a bit of the loveliness of English, [betoken by Borges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJYoqCDKoT4), is that it has these two strains.  Trying your hand at Anglish is a good way to learn the darker, deeper, earthier one, which you can then bring into your English as it befits you.

## Shortcomings

- [ ] it lacks some words! "*test*" and "*text*" are both not underlined, although they are from French!
- [ ] it doesn't get verbs in all bendings. so "*include*" is underlined but "*including*" is not
- [ ] it doesn't underline words with tokenmarks next to them (",.:/ and so on)
- [ ] it ignores big-first-letter words. is this a bug? likely. but what if you want to write about your friend named Grace? no unproblemed choosing here without it being a lot smarter
- [ ] the box of better words needs to scroll itself

## Dreams

- [ ] put on a way to get a BuiltMind to hint or help craft words. this will be hard, since BigTongueLikenesses are known for mangling truth and saying seemingly-good things that do not stand up, but would be doable, since they can be taught.
- [ ] make a chat fairway for folk to talk, betightened so that only anglish words are sent through
